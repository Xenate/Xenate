### - ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an online historical art market tailored for the wealthy. The purpose is the help the wealthy evade taxes while benefitting artists, museums, and abortion rights (it will be a non-profit).
### - ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Lambda Prolog, evpp, a+, c++, among other things.

### I am a 14 year interested in programming language design and social engineering but my real passion is new software technologies and performance programming. So far I am familiar with Fortran 95 and scala as my main language but I am looking to change that because scala is terrible (objects, objects, objects, blah, blah, blah). Oh you say it is both OOP and functional. Have fun with your foldable type classes and auxiliary constructors, idiot. I am designing an extremely fast logic based programming language with extremely terse syntax similar to k or a+ but closer to klong called Anlog. The language is based on lambda prolog, klong, and reverse mathematics. Anlog will be made for systems programming with support for pointers and what not so I can use it to rewrite fos (factored operating system) in and use to run servers for my online art market and other online projects.
