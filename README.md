### - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a logic based programming language and a higher order SMT solver.
### - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++

### I am a 15 year interested in programming language design and social engineering but my real passion is new software technologies and performance programming.  Scala is my main language but I am looking to change that because scala is terrible (objects, objects, objects, blah, blah, blah). Oh you say it is both OOP and functional. Have fun with your foldable type classes and auxiliary constructors, idiot. I am designing an extremely fast logic based programming language with extremely terse syntax  called Anlog.
