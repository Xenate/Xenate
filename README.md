### - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a logic based programming language.
### - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Lambda Prolog, prolog, and XPCE.
### - ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Does not matter

### I am a 14 year interested in programming language design and social engineering but my real passion is new software technologies and performance programming. So far I am familiar with Fortran 95 and scala as my main language but I am looking to change that because scala is terrible (objects, objects, objects, blah, blah, blah). Oh you say it is both OOP and functional. Have fun with your foldable type classes and auxiliary constructors, idiot. I am designing an extremely fast logic based programming language with extremely terse syntax similar to k or a+ but closer to klong called Anlog.
